# Code realated to a Typing Summit 2023 presentation on static type-coverage tools


This repo is a dumping ground for code related to collecting data and/or
learning about tools in preparation for a presentation at the 2023 PyCon Typing
Summit about static tooling for measuring and improving type coverage.

This talk, which I (Steven Troxler) will be giving, will be complemented by Carl Meyer
presenting on MonkeyType, a dynamic inspection library that also helps automate
improvements in type coverage.
